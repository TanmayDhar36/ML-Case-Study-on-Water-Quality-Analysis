# ML-Case-Study-on-Water-Quality-Analysis
A machine learning model which can accurately predict the water quality (potable/non-potable or safe/unsafe) based on various physicochemical parameters.  Desired outcome will be improve the water quality monitoring and decision-making, reduce waterborne disease outbreaks and optimize resource allocation for water treatment.
